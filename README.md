## Reaction dynamics of a unimolecular conformational isomerization in a bath

- Shibabrat Naik (School of Mathematics, University of Bristol)

Souce codes and scripts for studying the reaction dynamics using a system-bath model of a unimolecular conformational isomerization.

### Features

- Computing tube manifolds of the De Leon-Berne model of unimolecular conformational isomerization.

- Obtaining reactive islands for a range of total energies and model parameters.

- Computing Lagrangian descriptor on the $(x,p_x)$ slice in the 4D phase space of the De Leon-Berne model.
